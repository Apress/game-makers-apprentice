Welcome to the CD that accompanies <i>The Game Maker's Apprentice</i>. This CD
        will allow you to install the <i>Game Maker</i>  tool, read extra documentation,
        and access all the resources and games for the book (plus a few more for you to
experiment with).</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS">For your reference this CD contains the following folders:</font>
        <blockquote>
<h3 align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS"><a href="Program/" target="_blank">Program</a></font></h3>
          <p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS">This is where you will find
          the installation program for <i>Game Maker</i> (version 6.1A). <i>Game Maker</i> 
          can be installed onto your computer by executing <tt><font color="#008000">gmaker_inst.exe</font></tt>
from this folder (see Chapter 1 for details). This will add shortcuts for <i>Game
          Maker </i>into your Start menu so that you can run the program, read the
          documentation or uninstall it.&nbsp;</font>
          <p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS">The folder also contains a <a HREF="Program/readme.html">readme file</a> 
          which contains additional information and help for when a problem occurs. Also, please read the <a HREF="Program/license.html">license
agreement</a>  in this directory for using the <i>Game Maker </i>software.</font>
<h3 align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS"><a href="Documents/" target="_blank">Documents</a></font></h3>
          <p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS">
This folder contains the full documentation for <i>Game Maker</i> in a number of
different formats. <i>Game Maker</i> has many more features than the ones
described in this book so see the documentation for more information.</font>
<h3 align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS"><a href="Resources/" target="_blank">Resources</a></font></h3>
          <p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS">
This folder contains all the resources (graphics, music and sound effects)
          needed to create the games in the book plus a few bonus ones as well.
          There is a subfolder for each chapter containing the corresponding resources.</font>
          <p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS">In purchasing this book, the authors and publisher grant you permission to
use these electronic resources in your own <i>Game Maker</i> games, including
for commercial use. However, redistribution of these resources is prohibited, as
          is their use for games not made with <i>Game Maker</i>.</font>
<h3 align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS"><a href="Games/" target="_blank">Games</a></font></h3>
          <p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS">
This folder contains editable versions of all the games created in the book.
          There are generally several versions of each game showing them at
          different stages of construction. There is a subfolder for each chapter
          containing the corresponding game files. You are permitted to use these as the basis for your own games.
However, redistribution of the original games is prohibited and the authors
retain copyright of all the game concepts and names in this book.</font>
<h3 align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS"><a href="Finished/" target="_blank">Finished</a></font></h3>
          <p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS">
This folder contains finished executables of all the games created in the book.
          Most can be run directly from the CD, but some will give errors unless
          you copy the executables to your hard disk first (no special installation
          is required).</font>
